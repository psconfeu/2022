# Session slides and demo scripts from PowerShell Conference EU, 2022

## Note to Speakers:

- Please add a folder with your name, and then make a folder below that for each of your sessions, putting the all of the demos for each session into a .zip file.
- DO NOT update README.md with your sessions - one of us will update the table after we accept your pull request. It's less work for us this way.
