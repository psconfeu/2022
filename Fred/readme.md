# Session Materials by Fred

## The official presentations

+ [Putting Active Directory into Source Control](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/P2022-PSConfEU-Putting-Active-Directory-Into-Source-Control)
+ [PowerShell Security](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/P2022-PSConfEU-PowerShell-Security)

## From the Forum

While I _did_ brag about a lot of my toys, for some of the demos I actually grabbed the slot at the open forum and spoke to a larger audience.
There shall be no recordings from that, but ... I've got the notes and materials listed at least, including the presentation scripts to recreate much of it:

+ [Migrating AzureAD & MSOnline to MSGraph](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/P2022-PSConfEU-Forum-Demos/tree/master/PSConf.AzureADMigration)
+ [Logging in PowerShell with the PSFramework](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/P2022-PSConfEU-Forum-Demos/tree/master/PSConf.Logging)
+
